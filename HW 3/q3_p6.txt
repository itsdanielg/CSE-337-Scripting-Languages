i)	COMMAND:	find /usr/share/man/man1 -name "a*.gz" | wc -l
	OUTPUT:		59
	EXPLANATION: find /usr/share/man/man1 means it only looks within this directory
				-name "a*.gz" means it only looks for files that start with 'a' and ends with .gz (The extension)
				This is piped with wc -l, which prints the line count of the input

ii)	COMMAND:	find -L /usr/share/man/man1 -name "a*.gz" -xtype l | wc -l
	OUTPUT:		9
	EXPLANATION:	Same as above with a few additions
					-L means to follow symbolic links
					-xtype l means to only look for symbolic links
