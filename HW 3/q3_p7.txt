					cat /usr/share/dict/words | head -800 | tail -100 >>~/A3tmp/700-800.txt
		OUTPUT:		# See 300-500.txt and 700-800.txt
		EXPLANATION:	cat /usr/share/dict/words displays all words/lines in the file.
						This is piped with head -500 to display only the first 500 lines.
						This is again piped with tail -200 to display only lines 300-500.
						This is then redirected to ~/A3tmp/300-500.txt.
						This same concept is applied for lines 700-800.
